// Reconciles the 'status: needs-triage' label across all open issues and PRs. The label
// is fully owned by this automation: it is added to every item that matches a
// rule below and removed from every item that does not, on each run.
//
// An item is flagged when:
//   1. It is an issue without 'status: waiting-for-user-response' that is:
//      a. without a priority label, or
//      b. P0/P1 without an assignee, or
//      c. P0 and stale for more than 1 day, or
//      d. P1 and stale for more than 30 days, or
//      e. P2 and stale for more than 90 days.
//   2. It is a stale PR opened by an external contributor (PRs from
//      maintainers are managed by their authors).
//   3. It is an issue whose latest human comment is from an external author
//      and has gone unanswered for more than 1 day.
//
// "Stale" is measured from the last human contribution (a comment, or the
// opening post if there are no human comments) rather than `updated_at`, so the
// bot's own label edits never reset the clock. A PR is "stale" when no internal
// member has commented after the external author's last comment for more than a
// day.
//
// Flagged issues and PRs:
// https://github.com/a2ui-project/a2ui/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22status%3A%20needs-triage%22
//
// The job prints to console what items are flagged/unflagged and why. To see the
// history of runs see:
